A logical chatbot written in C++ that allows the user to keep track on the reported COVID-19 situation in the Philippines and create relevant predictions since the first Omicron variant case was announced in the later part of 2021.

COPTER uses data science to enable its users keep track and get updated on the COVID-19 situation in the Philippines since the first positive case of the Omicron variant was reported in the country. It can calculate today’s fatality and recovery rate based on the reported number of cases available in Worldometer – a website that keeps track of pertinent information like new cases, deaths and recoveries in countries all over the globe. Furthermore, it also has a prediction function, allowing users to see the predicted number of cases for the next seven (7) days based on its infection growth rate as well as calculate and predict when herd immunity can be achieved in the country.

With the continued prevalence of COVID-19 in the country and all over the globe, the group believes that this technology will continue to remain relevant in the next few years as it enables people to get up-to-date about the situation of the pandemic and act accordingly based on this data. Moreover, since the chatbot uses formulas often used in predicting the growth rate of epidemics, it can also be used for similar infectious diseases in the future.
